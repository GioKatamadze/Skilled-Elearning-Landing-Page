## Overview

In this project I mainly needed to focus on media queries and page responsiveness.

## My process

1. Change background color of body
2. Add background color a gradient effect
3. Create wrapper div
4. Add images and text
5. Give images sizes and styles in CSS
6. Give texts and icons font styles in CSS
7. Create hover effects for buttons and links

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- Mobile first approach

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained more practise of using Media Queries, the main challenge that I overcame was to create responsive page that would work on any screen. After research and practicing different ways for resolving this step, I wrote the CSS code using mobile first approach, that worked eventually and it gave me some confidence and knowledge of making wabsites responsive.

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master CSS to make more dynamic and interactive projects
